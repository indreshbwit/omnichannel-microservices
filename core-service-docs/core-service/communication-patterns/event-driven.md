# Event-Driven Communication Pattern

## Overview
Event-Driven communication is an **asynchronous pattern** where services emit events when state changes occur. Other services listen and react to these events independently.

---

## Usage in Core Service
* Tenant onboarding events
* User role updates
* Platform lifecycle events (creation, update, deletion)
* Audit logging events

## Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CoreService
    participant Kafka
    participant OtherService
    CoreService->>Kafka: Publish event (UserCreated)
    Kafka-->>OtherService: Deliver event asynchronously
    OtherService->>OtherService: Process event (e.g., sync user data)
Benefits
Loose coupling between services
Better scalability and fault tolerance
Enables reactive and real-time workflows
Drawbacks
Eventual consistency instead of immediate consistency
Complexity in error handling and event replay
Best Practices
Define clear event schemas and versioning
Use idempotency in event handlers
Monitor event queues and dead-letter topics

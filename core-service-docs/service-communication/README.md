# 📡 Service Communication

This section outlines the communication mechanisms between microservices in the Omnichannel Microservices Platform. It includes patterns, tools, and best practices for building scalable, observable, and resilient service interactions using **gRPC**, **Kafka**, **Service Discovery**, and **Feature Flags**.

## 🧩 Modules

### 🔌 gRPC Communication
- Efficient binary communication between services using Protocol Buffers and gRPC.
- Covers service definitions, client-server setup, and interceptors for logging, auth, etc.

📂 [`grpc/`](./grpc)
- [README](./grpc/README.md)
- [Service Definitions](./grpc/service-definitions.md)
- [Client-Server Communication](./grpc/client-server.md)
- [Interceptors](./grpc/interceptors.md)

---

### 📬 Kafka Event Streaming
- Asynchronous, decoupled communication using Kafka for domain events and logs.
- Ensures durability, ordering, and horizontal scalability.

📂 [`kafka/`](./kafka)
- [README](./kafka/README.md)
- [Topic Schemas](./kafka/topics-schemas.md)
- [Producers & Consumers](./kafka/producers-consumers.md)
- [Event Streaming Patterns](./kafka/event-streaming.md)

---

### 🌐 Interservice Communication Patterns
- Patterns for hybrid REST, gRPC, and event-driven communication.
- Emphasizes fault-tolerance, retries, circuit-breaking, and service boundaries.

📂 [`interservice/`](./interservice)
- [README](./interservice/README.md)
- [Communication Patterns](./interservice/communication-patterns.md)
- [Error Handling Strategies](./interservice/error-handling.md)

---

### 🧭 Service Discovery
- Ensures dynamic discovery of services using Kubernetes, Consul, or Istio.
- Supports scalability and auto-healing in distributed systems.

📂 [`service-discovery/`](./service-discovery)
- [README](./service-discovery/README.md)
- [Service Registration](./service-discovery/registration.md)
- [Discovery Mechanisms](./service-discovery/discovery.md)

---

### 🧪 Feature Flags
- Enables controlled rollout and testing of features in production.
- Promotes safe deployments and A/B testing across tenants or users.

📂 [`feature-flags/`](./feature-flags)
- [README](./feature-flags/README.md)
- [Feature Flag Implementation](./feature-flags/implementation.md)
- [Flag Configuration Patterns](./feature-flags/configuration.md)

---

## 📘 Usage

This documentation is part of the **Omnichannel Microservices Core Service**. It is meant to guide developers, SREs, and architects in designing and managing reliable interservice communication and runtime control.

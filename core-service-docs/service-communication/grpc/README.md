# gRPC Communication

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework developed by Google that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more.

This section covers:

- Service Definitions: How services and messages are defined using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files)
- Client-Server Model: Interaction patterns between gRPC clients and servers
- Interceptors: Middleware for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and error handling

We follow best practices to design, implement, and secure gRPC communication between microservices.

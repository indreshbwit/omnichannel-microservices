# gRPC Client and Server Architecture

This document outlines how the gRPC client and server components are structured, communicate, and integrate within the microservices architecture.

---

## Server Side

### Responsibilities

* Expose gRPC services defined in `.proto` files.
* Handle incoming RPC requests.
* Perform business logic and data operations.
* Return responses or stream data back to clients.
* Handle error conditions gracefully.
* Integrate with authentication and authorization middleware.

### Implementation Details

* Servers are implemented using gRPC server libraries available for the chosen language (e.g., Go, Python, Java, Node.js).
* Each microservice runs its own gRPC server instance, listening on a dedicated port.
* Servers support TLS encryption for secure communication.
* Support for interceptors/middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, authentication).

### Example (Python gRPC Server)

```python
from concurrent import futures
import grpc
import user_pb2_grpc
import user_service

def serve():
    server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10))
    user_pb2_grpc.add_UserServiceServicer_to_server(user_service.UserServiceServicer(), server)
    server.add_insecure_port('[::]:50051')
    server.start()
    server.wait_for_termination()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    serve()
Client Side
Responsibilities
Create stub/client objects to call remote gRPC service methods.
Manage connection pooling and retries.
Handle streaming if applicable.
Perform client-side validation where needed.
Integrate with client-side interceptors for logging, tracing, authentication.
Implementation Details
Clients use generated gRPC client code from the .proto definitions.
Connection can be secured with TLS.
Supports synchronous and asynchronous calls depending on language bindings.
Implements retry policies and backoff strategies for resiliency.
Example (Python gRPC Client)
Python

import grpc
import user_pb2
import user_pb2_grpc

def get_user(user_id):
    with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051') as channel:
        stub = user_pb2_grpc.UserServiceStub(channel)
        request = user_pb2.GetUserRequest(user_id=user_id)
        response = stub.GetUser(request)
        return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    user = get_user('1234')
    print(f"User: {user.username}, Email: {user.email}")
Security
Use TLS to secure gRPC channels.
Use authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) passed as metadata in RPC calls.
Implement authorization checks on the server.
Error Handling
gRPC defines status codes that servers return (e.g., NOT_FOUND, UNAVAILABLE).
Clients should handle these status codes properly and implement retries where appropriate.

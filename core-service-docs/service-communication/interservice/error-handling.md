# Interservice Error Handling

Reliable error handling between services is essential for system resilience.

---

## 1. gRPC / HTTP Error Handling

* Use **standard status codes** (e.g., `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `NOT_FOUND`).
* Attach **structured error metadata** for clients.
* Use **retry with exponential backoff** where appropriate.
* Implement **circuit breakers** (e.g., via Envoy/Istio).

**Example (Python gRPC)**:
```python
from grpc import StatusCode, RpcError

try:
    client.get_user(user_id)
except RpcError as e:
    if e.code() == StatusCode.NOT_FOUND:
        handle_user_not_found()
2. Kafka Error Handling
Handle consumer errors gracefully (e.g., malformed messages, downstream failures).
Use Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for undeliverable events.
Log errors with correlation IDs for traceability.
Ensure all consumers are idempotent.
3. Global Resilience Patterns
Timeouts and retries (with limits).
Bulkheads and isolation.
Monitoring, logging, and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry).
4. Observability
Correlation IDs across service boundaries.
Distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger).
Centralized error dashboards.
Best Practices
Never expose raw internal errors to external services.
Include enough context in logs and error payloads
Monitor for both hard failures and slowdowns

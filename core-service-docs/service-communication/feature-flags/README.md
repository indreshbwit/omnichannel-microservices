# Feature Flags

Feature flags (also known as feature toggles) are a software development technique that allows enabling or disabling features dynamically without deploying new code. They enable safer releases, gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and easy rollback.

This section covers the design, configuration, and implementation of feature flags within the service communication layer.
